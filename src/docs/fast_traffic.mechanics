These is a two-lane road

5|5
C|4
3|3
2|2
1|P

P = Player
C = Slow Cars to be overtaken by the player

In every frame/step, the cars will go down
If the player hit a car (their location became the same),
    the player loses
If the player is beside the car,
    the player gets rewarded

Implementation:
The lanes can be converted into 2d array (0-4 index)
Player will have an index position x, y where:
    x = position in the outer array index
    y = left/right = 0, 1
    Which means:
        Player is still at the end of road
    Player can have two choices:
        If Player is in left lane:
            - Go right (Action 0)
            - Stay put (Action 1)
        If Player is in right lane:
            - Go left (Action 0)
            - Stay put (Action 1)
Cars will be placed in 2d array as well,
    There can be zero to many cars in random moment
    Cars cannot occupy both lane at the same time
